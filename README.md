Currently, this software was only tested for MODIS and Landsat image fusion, and the input images must be registered and clipped to have the same geographic coverage. Moreover, the bands configuration of the input MODIS and Landsat images must be corresponding with each other. For more specific operations, please refer to the image fusion tutorials in the help file.
